# 3D-Cube
Colour changing, rotating 3D cube using HTML/CSS, JS and Three.js with webGL concepts.

## Purpose
- for fun 
- got bored studying for computer organization
- looked up a three.js tutorial and some documentation
- this is different from the documentation:
  - its changing in colours!
  - coded in OOP!
  - that's about it

## Overall
- had fun
- better usage of my time `100%`!
